# Simple client-server application

Simple web application. Server sends random positive number 'n' to client and this answer with numbers from 1 to n. Using sockets.
One of my first c# application so it is very amateur, but everyone has to start somewhere.

Project has been made for class from "Technologie sieciowe" (network technologies) at my third semester.
Fell free if You need this project at Your task in college.
